## General Information

Cardr is a piece of software that makes it easier for high-school and collegiate debaters to conduct research and generate citations for evidence.

### Launcher

*CardrLauncher/*

Archived. Not for general use.

### Desktop Client

*CardrDesktop/*

Cardr's Desktop Client is a program that creates debate cards for you. Once you paste in a webpage URL, you can easily manipulate attributes of the card (publication date, publisher, author(s), etc.) from the side panel. Cardr will automatically generate the citation, along with the card body, for you.

The Desktop Client was written almost entirely in Kotlin, but some parts use C++ (*CardrWindowsCPP/* and *CardrMacCPP/*) for access to Windows-specific and macOS-specific APIs. 

### Chrome Extension

*CardrExtension/*

The Chrome extension allows you to seamlessly integrate your research experience with the Cardr Desktop Client.
It allows you to "send" a website into the Desktop Client by clicking the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.

The Chrome extension was written using JavaScript.
